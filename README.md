## üõ† Projects

### üé• Movie Catalog System
*GraphQL, Apollo Server, REST API, Authentication*  
*May 2024*  
- **Overview:** The Movie Catalog System is a web application designed to allow users to browse, search, and manage a catalog of movies. It integrates GraphQL for querying and caching data, REST API for fetching additional movie details, and basic authentication for secure access control.
- **GraphQL Server:** Implemented a GraphQL server using Apollo Server with a schema supporting queries like `movies` to retrieve a list of movies and `searchMovies(title: String, genre: String)` to search by title or genre. Resolvers fetch data from a local cache and integrate with an external REST API for additional details.
- **REST API Integration:** Integrated with an external REST API (e.g., IMDb API) to fetch additional movie details and implemented caching mechanisms to store fetched data locally, improving performance.
- **Authentication:** Implemented basic authentication to restrict access to certain operations, requiring users to authenticate with a username and password.
- **Data Management:** Provided CRUD functionality allowing users to add, update, and delete movies in the catalog.
- **Performance:** Optimized caching mechanisms to minimize response times and reduce server load, and implemented pagination for browsing large sets of movies.
- **Security:** Ensured secure transmission of authentication credentials using HTTPS and restricted access to sensitive endpoints based on user roles and permissions.
- **Usability:** Designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface with clear instructions for using the GraphQL API and accessing protected endpoints.
- **Documentation:** Provided comprehensive documentation covering the GraphQL schema, REST API integration, and authentication mechanisms, including a README file with setup instructions and usage guidelines for running the application locally.
- **Additional Features:** Added support for pagination, user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and real-time updates using GraphQL subscriptions to notify users about new movies or changes to existing ones.
